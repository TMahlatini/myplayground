## [My UWC Experience](https://www.uwc.org)

My time at [UWC](https://www.uwc.org) was one of those things that hits you so hard, you almost don’t catch it because half of your brain's still stuck going, “Wait, am I actually here?” A few months back, it was just a wild dream and now I was living it, and it didn’t even feel real. 

I’m from a low-middle-income family in Zimbabwe. Growing up, studying in another country, never mind a whole different continent, wasn’t even on the radar. No chance. But then [YYAS](https://africanscholars.yale.edu/about-us) happened, and I met [Rosa](https://www.terence-m.live/notebook/conversations/Rosa), suddenly the narrative changed. August 19, 2019, I was at Mahindra United World College of India (MUWCI). 

There were about 250 students on campus representing 80+ countries. I was the only Zimbabwean, which was the deal for most of us— one kid per country, far from home. 

What does it mean to be Zimbabwean? What does it mean to be African? What does it mean to belong to a group? The questions began. 


From the moment I set foot on campus, I was on an emotional rollercoaster. Because so much happened in such a short time, I am still struggling to capture the essence of my experience. Those two years–2019 to 2021—had some of my best days and some of my worst. Highs that felt unreal, lows that knocked me flat. 

I know I am not nailing what made UWC so insane or why it messed with my head in the best way. I can’t pin it down yet—it’s too big. I’ll come back to this later, and rewrite it when I figure out the transformations that took place.

For now, I will express my gratitude. Special thanks to the [   Zimbabwean National Committee](https://www.zw.uwc.org/), the [Dare to Dream Program](https://www.uwc.org/daretodream), and [MUWCI](https://www.uwcmahindracollege.org/) for the scholarships that made it all possible.
