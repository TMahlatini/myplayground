## About me 

Hi, Iâ€™m Terence Mahlatini. 

I am currently a senior at Whitman College, graduating in May 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Outside academic work, I like working out, reading science fiction and watching movies. 

Timeless favorites: Interstellar and Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov.  

I also like learning new stuff and understanding the [Human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition). 

## About this site

In high school, I was forced to write reflections after every activity I did. I used to hate it because it never seemed relevant, but now, four years later, I wish I had never stopped writing. I have since read many books and had a lot of amazing conversations and experiences, but I have forgotten some because I never wrote them down. So, this is me trying to reflect on all the small and big things around me and within me for future me and anyone curious. 

This is also my playground for learning new things, technical and non-technical. I built this site from scratch using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will continue to update it as I learn more.
