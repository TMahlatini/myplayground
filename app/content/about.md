## About me 

Hi, Iâ€™m Terence Mahlatini. 

I am currently a senior at Whitman College, graduating in May 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Outside school, I like working out, reading science fiction and watching movies. 

Timeless favorites: Interstellar and Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov. 

I also like learning new stuff and understanding the [Human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition). 

## About this site

This is my playground for learning new things, technical and non-technical. I built this site from scratch using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will continue to update it as I learn more.

On the non-technical side, this is me trying to reflect on all the small and big things around me and within me for future me and anyone curious.
