At the high school I attended, they made us write reflections after every activity we did. I used to hate it because it was tedious, but now, four years later, I wish I had continued writing. I have since read many books and had a lot of amazing conversations and experiences, but I have forgotten some because I never wrote them down. So, this is me trying to reflect on all the small and big things around me and within me for future me and anyone curious. 



Here are the things you will find here: 

[Who am I?](/who)

[What am I doing now?](/now)

[Notes on books and (dangerous?) ideas.](/notes)


[Conversations with friends and cool strangers.](/experiences)
