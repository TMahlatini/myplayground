## About me 

Hi, Iâ€™m Terence Mahlatini. 

I am currently a senior at Whitman College, graduating in May 2025. Outside academic work, I like working out, reading science fiction and watching movies. 

Timeless favorites: Interstellar and Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov.  

I also like learning new stuff and understanding the Human condition. 

## About this site

In high school, I was forced to write reflections after every activity I did. I used to hate it because it never seemed relevant, but now, four years later, I wish I had never stopped writing. I have since read many books and had a lot of amazing conversations and experiences, but I have forgotten some because I never wrote them down. So, this is me trying to reflect on all the small and big things around me and within me for future me and anyone curious.
